## Plot Summary
 
The film begins with a flashback to 1975, where Asian Hawk (Jackie Chan) and his bandmates Alan (Alan Tam) and Laura (Rosamund Kwan) are performing at a concert in Europe. After the show, Asian Hawk decides to leave the band and pursue his passion for treasure hunting. He bids farewell to his friends and promises to keep in touch.
 
Eleven years later, in 1986, Asian Hawk is now a famous adventurer who has acquired many rare and valuable artefacts. He is hired by a wealthy collector named Baron Bannon (Bozidar Smiljanic) to find the pieces of the Armour of God, a legendary suit of armour that belonged to a crusader named Richard the Lionheart. The armour consists of five parts: the helmet, the breastplate, the shield, the sword, and the boots. Asian Hawk manages to locate and steal the sword from an African tribe, but he is pursued by a rival treasure hunter named May Bannon (Lola Forner), who is Baron Bannon's daughter and wants to claim the sword for herself.

Meanwhile, Alan has become a successful pop singer and Laura has become his manager. They are contacted by a mysterious man named Duke Scapio (Ken Boyle), who claims to be a fan of Alan's music and invites them to his mansion in Yugoslavia. However, it turns out that Duke Scapio is actually the leader of a religious cult called the Monks of Doom, who worship the Armour of God and believe that it can bring about the end of the world. They have kidnapped Laura and plan to use her as a sacrifice for their ritual.
 
Duke Scapio calls Alan and tells him that he will exchange Laura for the pieces of the Armour of God. He also tells him that he knows that Asian Hawk has one of them and that he should contact him immediately. Alan calls Asian Hawk and informs him about Laura's situation. Asian Hawk agrees to help Alan rescue Laura and retrieve the armour pieces.
 
Asian Hawk and Alan travel to Yugoslavia and meet up with May Bannon, who has followed them there. They decide to team up and infiltrate Duke Scapio's mansion. They manage to find Laura and free her from her cell, but they are discovered by Duke Scapio's men and have to fight their way out. They also encounter Duke Scapio himself, who wears the helmet and the breastplate of the Armour of God and demonstrates its power by shooting lightning bolts from his eyes.
 
Asian Hawk, Alan, Laura, and May escape from the mansion and head to a nearby monastery, where they find the shield and the boots of the Armour of God hidden in a secret chamber. They also learn that Duke Scapio has already obtained the sword from Asian Hawk's car, which he had left behind at the airport. They realize that they have to stop Duke Scapio from completing the armour and performing the ritual.
 
They return to Duke Scapio's mansion and confront him and his followers. A fierce battle ensues, in which Asian Hawk and Alan use their skills and wit to fight against Duke Scapio and his men. Asian Hawk manages to destroy the helmet and the breastplate of the Armour of God, while Alan manages to retrieve the sword. They then join forces and defeat Duke Scapio, who falls into a pit of fire.
 
Asian Hawk, Alan, Laura, and May celebrate their victory and hug each other. Asian Hawk and May kiss, while Alan and Laura reconcile. The film ends with a montage of outtakes and bloopers from the production.
 
## Analysis
 
Armour of God is a classic example of Jackie Chan's style of filmmaking, which combines action, comedy, and adventure. The film showcases Chan's physical prowess, comedic timing, and creative use of props and environments. The film also features some of Chan's most daring and dangerous stunts, such as jumping from a cliff onto a hot air balloon, sliding down a mountain slope on a wooden shield, and fighting on top of a moving truck.
 
The film also has a strong sense of adventure, as it takes the viewers to various exotic locations, such as France, Spain, Morocco, Yugoslavia, and Austria. The film draws inspiration from other adventure films, such as Indiana Jones and James Bond, but adds its own unique twist and charm. The film also has a humorous tone, as it pokes fun at various clichés and stereotypes, such as cults, pop stars, and treasure hunters.
 
The film also has a simple but engaging plot, which revolves around the quest for the Armour of God. The film explores the themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and love. The film also has some memorable characters, such as Asian Hawk, Alan, Laura, May, Duke Scapio, and Baron Bannon.

The film is not without its flaws, however. The film suffers from some editing issues, continuity errors, plot holes, and logical inconsistencies. The film also has some scenes that may be considered offensive or inappropriate by today's standards, such as racial stereotypes, sexual innuendos, animal abuse, and violence against women.
